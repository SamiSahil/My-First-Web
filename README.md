This project is a Modern School Management System (SMS), a comprehensive web application designed to manage all the essential activities of a school. It's built entirely with frontend technologies: HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

Think of it as a complete, self-contained dashboard that runs directly in your web browser without needing a separate backend server. It simulates a database and an API within the JavaScript file, making it a perfect example of a powerful, client-side application.

It features:

Role-Based Access: The experience is tailored for three different user types: Admin, Teacher, and Student.

Modern UI: A clean, responsive design that includes a dark mode toggle.

Rich Features: Modules for managing students, teachers, classes, attendance, fees, exams, notices, and more.

Interactive Elements: Includes data tables with sorting, animated modals for forms, charts for data visualization, and toast notifications for user feedback.
